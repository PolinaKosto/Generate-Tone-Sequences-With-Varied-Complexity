# Generate-Tone-Sequences-With-Varied-Complexity
I am creating a model that will allow to generate tone sequences with control of complexity. My definition of complexity is inspired by the work of Tuomas Eerola: 

Here is the word file where I explain how the model functions and how I chose intervals for parameter randomization.
