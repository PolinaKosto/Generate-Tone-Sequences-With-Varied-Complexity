# Generate-Tone-Sequences-With-Varied-Complexity
I am creating a model that will allow to generate tone sequences with control of complexity. My definition of complexity is inspired by the work of Tuomas Eerola. 

Here is the file where I explain how the model functions and how I chose intervals for parameter randomization. https://docs.google.com/document/d/13wMPpF3qoERLTs6o4_vjkKKWsoAHMMRO7E9BrKFap2k/edit?usp=sharing

And here is me trying to develop an experimental protocol allowing to complete the model : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HdF7nSFbQGlPtVJieEO3igX9ixAn2NnfcT84V3xbOqM/edit?usp=sharing
